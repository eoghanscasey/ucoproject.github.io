- title: 0.1.0
  date: 2017-01-05
  desc: Initial (“prototype”) release of the UCO ontology.
- title: 0.3.0
  date: 2019-07-13
  desc: The content of v0.3.0 is primarily of fixing lexical, syntactic and semantic reasoning errors present in v0.2.0 and simplifying in some areas.
- title: 0.4.0
  date: 2020-06-01
  desc: UCO Version 0.4.0 is primarily focused on fixing syntax & structural errors, splitting domain assertions into companion files and moving some controlled vocabulary enumerations into a separate vocabulary namespace using a new specification approach.
- title: 0.5.0
  date: 2020-11-18
  desc: UCO 0.5.0 is primarily focused on the removal of the investigation namespace from UCO (that namespace now resides in the CASE ontology) and on the renaming of several classes (Observable subclasses, Facet subclasses) in the observable namespace and a single property (core:facet) to support improved alignment with the CASE ontology and the forthcoming addition of ObservableObject subclasses.
- title: 0.6.0
  date: 2021-03-25
  desc: UCO 0.6.0 is primarily focused on adding several community needed classes (URLHistory, refactoring Contact, OnlineService, Profile, etc.) and properties, refactoring and cleaning up Address subclass structure, adding specific subclasses of ObservableObject, renaming of non-observable namespace Facet subclasses to include "Facet" at the end, clarifying and normalizing all class definitions to make the ontology more robust and complete, and cleanup of several minor issues and bugs.
- title: 0.7.0
  date: 2021-08-18
  desc: UCO 0.7.0 is primarily focused on the conversion of UCO ontologies to leverage the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) rather than domain assertions and owl property restrictions to define class shapes. In addition, it added a Continuous Integration (CI) method for testing and verifying the ontology and it corrects several minor issues and bugs.
- title: 0.8.0
  date: 2022-03-23
  desc: UCO 0.8.0 is primarily focused on an initial implementation of Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) review of semi-open vocabulary usage, restructuring of all UCO ontology IRIs and file structures to enable delivery of ontology resources from a new subdomain, flattening actionActionReferencesFacet properties directly onto action:Action, normalizing decimal number properties to xsd:decimal, improvements to unit and CI testing, numerous modifications and improvements to the Observable namespace, and correcting several minor issues and bugs.
- title: 0.9.0
  date: 2022-06-16
  desc: UCO 0.9.0 primarily focused on workflow technology transitions, and was necessitated by a Java dependency upgrade. The workflow used to normalize Turtle files in UCO and in downstream repositories now minimally requires Java 11, which impacts several public repositories—especially within the CASE community—that present Turtle files as part of their review process. The workflow to interface with the UCO and CASE ontologies has transitioned to Github Issues, which has caused some files related to programming Github interfaces to become versioned with the ontology. SHACL documentation will now use sh:description when documenting SHACL shapes. OWL-level ontological commitments are being restored since the transition to SHACL, starting with clarifying that core:UcoObject and core:Facet are disjoint classes. In SHACL validation updates, 0.9.0 refines some properties in email stub graph objects, polyglot designations with multiple MIME types, and a correction with names of accounts.
- title: 0.9.1
  date: 2022-08-TODO
  desc: UCO 0.9.1 implements a starting point in UCO for ontology version designation and backwards-compatibility tracking.  OWL versioning features are implemented and tested on top of UCO 0.9.0, as part of demonstrating version incrementing for UCO 1.0.0 and exercising the documentation deployment process.  No other changes are implemented since UCO 0.9.0.
